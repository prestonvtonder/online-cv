    title: About
    summary: |
      I am a young, motivated mathematician and software engineer with a broad background
      in computer science and a firm foundation in the field of mathematics. I believe that
      it is important for me to build on my academic foundations and stay in tune with the
      latest technological developments. This is why am always on the lookout for new
      challenges and novel things to learn. It is through this approach that I hope to
      gain the practical experience, as a 3rd year university student, to develop myself professionally.

        tagline: "A fun mobile application that synchronizes the lip movements of an animated image
                  of a mouth with a voice stream recorded using the phoneâ€™s microphone. The mobile
                  application is accompanied by a web service to support the installation, configu-
                  ration and customization of Mouthpiece. The core feature of the application, the
                  real-time lip-syncing animation, is implemented using a Recurrent Neural Network."
